# Python-mmk-game
A m,m,k-game (like a [m,n,k-game](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=M,n,k-game&oldid=1220678259), but only supports square arrays) generator made in Python. You can choose how the table will be in length (only square tables are supported so far) and how many players will play! Will add further documentation and extend later
